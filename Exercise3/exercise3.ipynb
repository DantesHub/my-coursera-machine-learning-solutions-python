    "In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits. Before starting the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n",

    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, and [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) for scientific and numerical computation functions and tools. You can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)."

The `.mat` format means that that the data has been saved in a native Octave/MATLAB matrix format, instead of a text (ASCII) format like a csv-file. We use the `.mat` format here because this is the dataset provided in the MATLAB version of this assignment. Fortunately, python provides mechanisms to load MATLAB native format using the `loadmat` function within the `scipy.io` module. This function returns a python dictionary with keys containing the variable names within the `.mat` file. \n",

Each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is “unrolled” into a 400-dimensional vector. Each of these training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix `X`. This gives us a 5000 by 400 matrix `X` where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image.\n",

One common strategy for debugging is to print out the sizes of the matrices you are working with using the `shape` property of `numpy` arrays. For example, given a data matrix $X$ of size $100 \\times 20$ (100 examples, 20 features) and $\\theta$, a vector with size $20$, you can observe that `np.dot(X, theta)` is a valid multiplication operation, while `np.dot(theta, X)` is not. Furthermore, if you have a non-vectorized version of your code, you can compare the output of your vectorized code and non-vectorized code to make sure that they produce the same outputs.\n",

    "**python/numpy Tip:** When implementing the vectorization for regularized logistic regression, you might often want to only sum and update certain elements of $\\theta$. In `numpy`, you can index into the matrices to access and update only certain elements. For example, A[:, 3:5]\n",
    "= B[:, 1:3] will replaces the columns with index 3 to 5 of A with the columns with index 1 to 3 from B. To select columns (or rows) until the end of the matrix, you can leave the right hand side of the colon blank. For example, A[:, 2:] will only return elements from the $3^{rd}$ to last columns of $A$. If you leave the left hand size of the colon blank, you will select elements from the beginning of the matrix. For example, A[:, :2] selects the first two columns, and is equivalent to A[:, 0:2]. In addition, you can use negative indices to index arrays from the end. Thus, A[:, :-1] selects all columns of A except the last column, and A[:, -5:] selects the $5^{th}$ column from the end to the last column. Thus, you could use this together with the sum and power ($^{**}$) operations to compute the sum of only the elements you are interested in (e.g., `np.sum(z[1:]**2)`). In the starter code, `lrCostFunction`, we have also provided hints on yet another possible method computing the regularized gradient.\n",

    "After training your one-vs-all classifier, you can now use it to predict the digit contained in a given image. For each input, you should compute the “probability” that it belongs to each class using the trained logistic regression classifiers. Your one-vs-all prediction function will pick the class for which the corresponding logistic regression classifier outputs the highest probability and return the class label (0, 1, ..., K-1) as the prediction for the input example.

However, logistic regression cannot form more complex hypotheses as it is only a linear classifier (You could add more features - such as polynomial features - to logistic regression, but that can be very expensive to train).\n",

The neural network will be able to represent complex models that form non-linear hypotheses. For this week, you will be using parameters from a neural network that we have already trained. Your goal is to implement the feedforward propagation algorithm to use our weights for prediction. In next week’s exercise, you will write the backpropagation algorithm for learning the neural network parameters. \n",

    "Now you will implement feedforward propagation for the neural network. You will need to complete the code in the function `predict` to return the neural network’s prediction. You should implement the feedforward computation that computes $h_\\theta(x^{(i)})$ for every example $i$ and returns the associated predictions. Similar to the one-vs-all classification strategy, the prediction from the neural network will be the label that has the largest output $\\left( h_\\theta(x) \\right)_k$.\n",

The matrices `Theta1` and `Theta2` contain the parameters for each unit in rows. Specifically, the first row of `Theta1` corresponds to the first hidden unit in the second layer. In `numpy`, when you compute $z^{(2)} = \\theta^{(1)}a^{(1)}$, be sure that you index (and if necessary, transpose) $X$ correctly so that you get $a^{(l)}$ as a 1-D vector.\n",
